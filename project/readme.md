# Project

During the semester, teams will work on developing a to-do app capable of 
tracking tasks. As new topics are introduced during the semester, teams will be 
expected to implement similar functionality in their apps.  The apps will be 
reviewed at sever points during the semester. The features that should be 
implemented prior to each review are listed below; see milestones.  In addition 
to submitting the app developed by the team, each team member is expected to 
submit a brief summary of his/her contributions since the last review.  During 
finals week, each team will present their app to the class.

A mocked-up example of a to-do app can be found 
[here](todo-prototype/frame.html).  This example only demonstrates some 
functionality of the app to be developed; see the description and milestones 
above for more details.
